CS225.012 Proj4 Maintain Project

This project's goal is to practice testing, debugging, and software maintenance, which are valuable skills for every software developer. So, you will work on the code that other students have implemented.
Now that you have completed the individual work for part 1, here are the list of work to be done to complete this project:
Part 2:
Make a list of tasks, based on items in part 1, to maintain/improve the program. There should be 3 categories of tasks: bugs, improvements, new features. Be sure to indicate the difficulty and time requirement for each task.
Each team will summarize individual work done by team members and identify ONE list for part 2.
     Team 1: Carlos, Arjun, David, Justin, Jovan
     Team 2: Yuliia, Christian, Kevin, Alland




One student from each team will be selected by others in the team to be the lead. 
The leads will communicate with me about their team's plan to complete the work
Each team will have their own github repository
Be sure to add plenty of comments on the files as well as the team's github, to demonstrate what changes have been done and by whom.
Create a javadoc for one class
Submit the maintained code and all documents in a zip file or the link to the team's Github repository by the due date.
Each student should submit their own Team Assessment by April 11
